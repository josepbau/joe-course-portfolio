        <h1>My Dev Tools Vandalism</h1>
        <p>
            I used browser developer tools to temporarily "vandalize" a
            website. Below is a screenshot showing my changes. These edits
            only appeared on my computer and did not affect the actual
            website.
        </p>
        <div class="screenshot-container">
            <!-- 
                IMPORTANT: Update the src attribute below to match your screenshot filename.
                Example: If your screenshot is named "apple-dot-com-but-with-papyrus-font.png", change the line to:
                src="./apple-dot-com-but-with-papyrus-font.png"
            -->
            <img src="./devtools-vandalism-screenshot.png" alt="Screenshot of the webpage I vandalized" />
        </div>
        <h2>Today I vandalized Lowes.com!!</h2>
        <p> I vandalized the Lowe's Website at https://www.lowes.com/l/savings/appliance-savings?int_cmp=Home%3AA1%3AAppliances%3APromo%3APW40_25_Appliances  
            and made changes to the Black Friday sale image and changed the width to 30% as well as Changed the color of the text to bright pink and changed 
            the text-align: left.  I also made changes to the background color of the the div to lime green
            Describe the changes you made to the website using the browser's developer tools. Some potential questions
            to consider:
        <ul>
            <li>I edited the heading that said, "Applliance Deals" and changed it to "Expensive Appliances!!! Refridgerators that cost more than a 2014 Honda Civic
                from Craigslist" </li>
            <li>The CSS edits that I made were the font color to pink, the width to 30% and background color to lime green.  Also changed align-text of the heading to align right.</li>
            <li>What made the changes interesting was the bright colors compared to the original white background of the orininal layout.  The bright text and background were highly noticeable.
                I was also surprised that I couldn't edit the headings.  I tried to do this on a previous webpage such as CNN, but I guess I couldn't because of the content and the news./li>
            <li>Yes, I understood that some echanges did not apply in the HTML portion because the styling portion was needed to be done in the CSS styles portion.</li>
            <li>I chose the items that I edited becuase they were the obvious changes that stood out compared to the old site.</li>
            <li>I was able to understand that HTML helped me identify the sections I was making the changes in and what portions that had text.</li>
            <li>I beleive I have an idea of how to identify some things but other portions or sections are still a little confusing to me.</li>
        </ul>
