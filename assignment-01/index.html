    <h1>My Top 5 NFL Teams</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <h2> Dallas Cowboys</h2>
            <p> America's Team and my favorite team since birth!</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h2> Houston Texans</h2>
            <p> My second favorite team only by default. Just because they are from Texas.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h2> Chicago Bears</h2>
            <p> This is my wife's favorite team because she grew up near Chicago in the neighboring state of Indiana.</p>
        </li>
        <li> 
            <h2> Green Bay Packers</h2>
            <p> I have such a love hate relationship for this team, especially with all the heartache they've caused for us in previous seasons.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h2> Los Angeles Chargers</h2>
            <p> I think I'm more attracted to these guys location and their uniforms. Both are really cool and they also have some talented teams.</p>
        </li>
