            This is my collecetion of my All-Time favorite Dallas COwboys Players! Ever since I was a young boy I have always been a die hrad Dallas Cowboys fan.
            I'm now a father of a young 6 year old boy who is following in my foot steps.  I can honestly say we had some good Ol' Glory Days, but lately that has 
            not been the case.  I tell my son all the time, it's ok to not like my team and that he has the freedom to choose his own.  Still he remians loyal to 
            out eam and fully supports the blue and silver!

                    Emmitt Smith is my All-Time favorite Dallas Cowboy!  Growing up, I couldn't wait to watch him every Sunday to watch him run that ball down the 
                    field and break tackles.  Most of all my favorite part was watching him cross that goal line with a fierce run to help his team gain a victory.
