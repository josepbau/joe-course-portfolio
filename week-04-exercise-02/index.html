            This is my collecetion of my All-Time favorite Dallas COwboys Players! Ever since I was a young boy I have always been a die hrad Dallas Cowboys fan.
            I'm now a fathe ro fyo9ung 6 year old boy who is following in my foot steps.  I can honestly say we had some good Ol' Glory Days, but lately that has 
            not been the case.  I tell my son all the time, it's ok to not like my team and that he has the freedom to choose his own.  Still he remians loyal to 
            out eam and fully supports the blue and silver!

                    Emmitt Smith is my All-Time favorite Dallas Cowboy!  Growing up, I couldn't wait to watch him every Sunday to watch him run that ball down the 
                    field and break tackles.  Most of all my favorite part was watching him cross that goal line with a fierce run to help his team gain a victory.

                    This game was unexpectedly fun and a great way to enjoy the Indiana Jones universe from a different
                    perspective. I had zero expectations and didn't play it immediately after release, but I'm glad I
                    decided to buy it when it went on sale. Was it a perfect game? No! But was it an engaging
                    single-player experience that let me pretend I was an adventurous archaeologist? Yes! And
                    really,that's all you need from a game, right? <em>**cracks whip emphatically!**</em>

                    Jason Witten played 17 seasons in the NFL and spent 16 of them with my Dallas Cowboys.  He is the team's leading Pass-Catcher and will soon 
                    be inducted into the Hall of Fame in 2026.  Jason Witten was also my late Father's favorite Dallas Cowboy player. My father was never one to wear jerseys 
                    but he would proudly were that #82 jersey with pride.  Jason Witten wasn't just a great football, he was also a great human being with his philanthropy 
                    work off the field.  In 2012 Jason Witten was awarded the Wallter Payton NFL Man of the Year Award for his philanthropic work with his foundation.
